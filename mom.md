Dear Mom,

Happy Mother's day! I racked my brain for the last two weeks trying to figure out what to do or get for Mother's day for you, but the world is weird right now and even simple gifts like flower deliveries feel risky. So I thought I'd write a letter, sent by email.

I love you Mom, thank you so much for how you raised me. Keeping three little boys alive is hard, let alone raising them to love Jesus, to be patient, kind, gentle, respectful, and loving all while modeling the same. I am understanding what an amazing gift that is more every day. I'm sure I have no idea what I'm still in for, but given what I do know it makes me appreciate you more than ever.

Thank you so much for your patience with me (and David and Daniel). Being patient is HARD. Boys have some really crazy ideas and no filters. I'm sure it wasn't easy, because it's not easy for me. Thank you for making it look that way. Thanks for tolerating my zoo's worth of scaly, creepy/crawly pets, my disaster of a room, and my wacky interests and hobbies. For bringing me my lunch and homework more times than you should have. I only hope I'm as graceful with my kids and I know I have a lot to learn.

Thank you for modeling gentleness and kindness. It's really hard not to be harsh, dismissive, and disinterested sometimes. I can't think of a single time I ever felt that way from you. Thanks for always giving me the hug, listening ear, or firm reminder I needed, and for oozing love while you did it. I hope my kids remember their childhooks with me me the same way I remember mine with you.

And finally thank you so much for teaching me to love Jesus, to lean on him for comfort and strength, and to love learning about him. I hope and pray daily with my boys that they'll grow up loving him and others with all their hearts, and it's a legacy I hope they also pass down.

I love you Mom. Thanks for being an awesome, Mom. I hope this super weird Mother's day is great for you and I can't wait to make you a really awesome Mother's Day dinner next time we see you.

Love you,

Chris
