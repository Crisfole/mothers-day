      I racked my brain for the last two weeks trying to
      figure out what to do or get for Mother's day for you, but the world is
      weird right now and even simple gifts like flower deliveries feel risky.
      So I thought I'd make you this card!
    </p>

    <p>
      I love you, Mom. Thank you so much for how you raised me. Keeping three
      little boys <i>alive</i> is hard, let alone raising them to love Jesus, to
      be patient, kind, gentle, respectful, and loving (all while modeling the
      same). Being your son is a gift that I understand more and more every day
      as I try hard to imitate that same spirit as I raise my boys. I'm sure I
      have no idea what I'm still in for, but given what I do know it makes me
      appreciate you more than ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you so much for your patience with me (and David and Daniel). Being
      patient is HARD. Boys have some really crazy ideas and no filters. I'm
      sure it wasn't easy for you, because it's not easy for me, but you made it
      look easy. Thank you for that. Thanks for tolerating my zoo's worth of
      scaly, creepy/crawly pets, my disaster of a room, and my wacky interests,
      hobbies and friends. (Sorry guys, you kinda were üòÅ). Thanks for bringing
      me my lunch and homework more times than you should have, for bailing me
      out of problems I created myself, and so much more. I only hope I'm as
      patient and graceful with my own kids. I still have a lot to learn from
      you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for modeling gentleness and kindness. It's really hard not to be
      harsh, dismissive, and disinterested sometimes. I can't think of a single
      time I ever felt that way from you. Thanks for always giving me the hug,
      listening ear, or firm reminder I needed, and for oozing love the whole
      time. I hope my kids remember their childhoods with me me the same way I
      remember mine with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      And finally, and most importantly, thank you so much for teaching me to
      love Jesus, to lean on him for comfort and strength, and to love learning
      about him. I hope and pray daily with my boys that they'll grow up loving
      him and others with all their hearts. The legacy I got from you I'm trying
      my hardest to pass on to them, and I hope and pray they pass it on to
      their own children some day.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love you Mom. Thanks for being awesome. I hope this super weird Mother's
      day is great for you and I can't wait to make you a really awesome
      Mother's Day dinner next time we see you.
